# tiamblia-original

This is the original experiment, precursor to [Tiamblia](https://github.com/1j01/tiamblia-game)

You can play around with it [here](http://1j01.github.io/tiamblia-original/).
There's no default world, so you'll have to press <kbd>E</kbd> to enter editing mode and draw polygons to create some terrain.
Right click to delete a terrain polygon. Place some trees by selecting Tree from the Entities bar and clicking where you want the bases of some trees to be.

Use the arrow keys or <kbd>WASD</kbd> to move, <kbd>down</kbd> to mount/unmount a steed.
Press <kbd>F</kbd> to fly.
